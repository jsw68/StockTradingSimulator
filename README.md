# StockTradingSimulator
Technologies used: Python, Django, JavaScript, HTML, DjangoAuth

A tool which allows the user to execute fake stock transactions on a number of tickers. The tool receives its stock market data from an API and keeps track of the necessary price data. Additionally, there is a visualization feature which allows the user to view a number of metrics for the selected ticker and their history on an interactive graph. 

NOTE: The API used by the project has since been deprecated so will not work without modification.
